###What is ARO MicrOS?

Think of ARO MicrOS as my attempt to create a cross platform 'OS' for microcontroller based platforms. Current device platforms that I'm working on are [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) and [Spark](http://spark.io). My end goal is to have a library that I can simply upload to devices and be able to have them do my bidding without writing anymore code!

###Source
[Available on Github](https://github.com/PracticalMaker/ARO-MicrOS)

###  Commands
Commands are used to interact with ARO MicrOS without having to write code by yourself. Think of it as being able to configure device functions and write automation functions without having to write a single line of code by yourself!
